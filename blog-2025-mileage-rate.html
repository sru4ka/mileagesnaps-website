            <p>Great news for self-employed workers: The IRS has increased the standard mileage rate to <strong>$0.70 per mile</strong> for business use of your vehicle in 2025, up from $0.67 in 2024. This is one of the highest rates in IRS history, making proper mileage tracking more valuable than ever.</p>

            <h2>What Is the Standard Mileage Rate?</h2>
            <p>The standard mileage rate is the amount you can deduct per mile driven for business purposes. Instead of tracking actual car expenses (gas, maintenance, insurance, depreciation), you simply multiply your business miles by the IRS rate.</p>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <strong>2025 IRS Mileage Rates:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Business:</strong> $0.70 per mile (up 3¢ from 2024)</li>
                    <li><strong>Medical/Moving:</strong> $0.21 per mile (for active-duty military)</li>
                    <li><strong>Charitable:</strong> $0.14 per mile (set by statute, rarely changes)</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h2>How Much Can You Save?</h2>
            <p>Let's break down the actual dollar savings for different types of workers:</p>

            <h3>Rideshare Drivers (Uber/Lyft)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Average miles:</strong> 15,000/year</li>
                <li><strong>Deduction:</strong> 15,000 × $0.70 = <strong>$10,500</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Tax savings (25% bracket):</strong> $2,625</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Delivery Drivers (DoorDash/Instacart)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Average miles:</strong> 12,000/year</li>
                <li><strong>Deduction:</strong> 12,000 × $0.70 = <strong>$8,400</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Tax savings (25% bracket):</strong> $2,100</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Real Estate Agents</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Average miles:</strong> 8,000/year</li>
                <li><strong>Deduction:</strong> 8,000 × $0.70 = <strong>$5,600</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Tax savings (25% bracket):</strong> $1,400</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Freelancers/Contractors (Client Visits)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Average miles:</strong> 5,000/year</li>
                <li><strong>Deduction:</strong> 5,000 × $0.70 = <strong>$3,500</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Tax savings (25% bracket):</strong> $875</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Who Qualifies for the Standard Mileage Rate?</h2>
            <p>You can use the standard mileage rate if you:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>✅ Are self-employed (1099 contractor, sole proprietor, LLC)</li>
                <li>✅ Own or lease the vehicle you're deducting</li>
                <li>✅ Did NOT claim depreciation using certain methods (MACRS)</li>
                <li>✅ Did NOT use the vehicle for hire (taxis are excluded)</li>
                <li>✅ Do NOT operate 5+ vehicles simultaneously (fleet rule)</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="warning-box">
                <strong>Important:</strong> You must choose between the standard mileage rate and actual expense method in the first year you use a vehicle for business. Once you pick the standard mileage rate, you can switch to actual expenses in later years - but NOT the other way around.
            </div>

            <h2>What Counts as "Business Miles"?</h2>
            <p>Business miles include driving:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>From your home to a client/customer (if home is your primary office)</li>
                <li>Between job sites or client meetings</li>
                <li>To pick up supplies/materials for your business</li>
                <li>For Uber/Lyft/delivery trips (while "on the clock")</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>NOT business miles:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>❌ Commuting from home to a regular workplace</li>
                <li>❌ Personal errands (groceries, gym, visiting friends)</li>
                <li>❌ Uber/Lyft with the app off (driving home after a shift)</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>How to Calculate Your Deduction</h2>
            <p>The formula is simple:</p>
            <div class="highlight-box">
                <strong>Total Business Miles × $0.70 = Your Deduction</strong>
            </div>

            <p><strong>Example:</strong> You're an Uber driver. In 2025, you drove:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>15,230 miles with the Uber app on (business)</li>
                <li>5,100 miles personal (commuting, errands)</li>
                <li>Total odometer: 20,330 miles</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Your deduction:</strong> 15,230 × $0.70 = <strong>$10,661</strong></p>

            <h2>How to Track Your Mileage Properly</h2>
            <p>The IRS requires "adequate records" for mileage deductions. You must track:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Date</strong> of each trip</li>
                <li><strong>Starting and ending locations</strong> (or just destination/area)</li>
                <li><strong>Miles driven</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Business purpose</strong> (e.g., "Client meeting," "Uber shift," "Delivery run")</li>
            </ol>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Photo-based tracking (like MileageSnaps) is more audit-proof than GPS logs. Taking pictures of your odometer at the start and end of work shifts creates timestamped, tamper-proof evidence that satisfies IRS requirements.
            </div>

            <h2>Standard Mileage vs. Actual Expenses: Which Is Better?</h2>

            <h3>Use Standard Mileage Rate If:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>You have a fuel-efficient car (hybrid, small sedan)</li>
                <li>You drive HIGH mileage (15,000+ miles/year)</li>
                <li>You want simple record-keeping (just track miles, not receipts)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Use Actual Expenses If:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>You drive a gas-guzzler or luxury vehicle</li>
                <li>You have HIGH car expenses (expensive repairs, insurance)</li>
                <li>You drive LOW mileage but have significant costs</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Example comparison:</strong> You drove 10,000 business miles in 2025.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Standard Mileage:</strong> 10,000 × $0.70 = $7,000</li>
                <li><strong>Actual Expenses:</strong> Gas ($2,500) + Insurance ($1,800) + Maintenance ($900) + Depreciation ($3,200) = $8,400 × 50% business use = $4,200</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In this case, <strong>standard mileage wins</strong> ($7,000 vs $4,200).</p>

            <h2>Common Mistakes to Avoid</h2>

            <h3>1. Claiming 100% Business Use</h3>
            <p>The IRS will question how you never drive your car personally. Be realistic: most drivers are 60-80% business use.</p>

            <h3>2. Round Numbers</h3>
            <p>Claiming exactly "15,000 miles" or "10,000 miles" looks suspicious. Precise tracking (e.g., 14,873 miles) shows you kept real records.</p>

            <h3>3. No Supporting Documentation</h3>
            <p>If you're audited, "I drove a lot for work" won't cut it. You need a mileage log with dates, destinations, and purposes.</p>

            <h3>4. Mixing Personal and Business Trips</h3>
            <p>If you stop for groceries during a business trip, you can't claim those personal miles. Only the business portion counts.</p>

            <h2>When Does the 2025 Rate Apply?</h2>
            <p>The $0.70 rate applies to miles driven from <strong>January 1, 2025, through December 31, 2025</strong>. If you drove business miles in 2024, you must use the 2024 rate ($0.67) for those trips on your 2024 tax return.</p>

            <div class="warning-box">
                <strong>Filing Tip:</strong> You'll report your mileage deduction on Schedule C (Form 1040) if you're self-employed. The deadline to file your 2024 taxes (claiming 2024 miles) is April 15, 2025. Start tracking your 2025 miles NOW so you're ready for next year's return.

            <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

            <h3>Can I deduct miles driven to my regular job?</h3>
            <p>No. Commuting from home to a W-2 job isn't deductible. But if you're self-employed and work from home, trips to clients ARE deductible.</p>

            <h3>What if I forgot to track miles all year?</h3>
            <p>You can reconstruct your mileage log using calendar entries, bank statements, or GPS history. But the IRS prefers contemporaneous records (created at the time), so start tracking TODAY for 2025.</p>

            <h3>Do I need receipts for the standard mileage rate?</h3>
            <p>No! That's the beauty of the standard rate. You don't need gas receipts or maintenance invoices - just your mileage log.</p>

            <h3>Can I switch from actual expenses to standard mileage?</h3>
            <p>Only if you used the standard rate in the first year you drove the vehicle for business. If you started with actual expenses, you're locked in.</p>
