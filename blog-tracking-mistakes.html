            <h1>10 Mileage Tracking Mistakes That Trigger IRS Audits</h1>

            <p>Every year, thousands of self-employed workers lose mileage deductions - worth $2,000-$10,000 - because of easily avoidable mistakes. Here are the top 10 red flags that trigger IRS audits, and how to fix them.</p>

            <h2>Mistake #1: Claiming 100% Business Use</h2>
            <p><strong>The Red Flag:</strong> Your mileage log shows you drove 18,000 miles for work and 0 miles personally.</p>
            <p><strong>Why It's Bad:</strong> The IRS knows you use your car for groceries, doctor visits, and social activities. Claiming 100% business use screams "audit me."</p>
            <p><strong>The Fix:</strong> Be realistic. Most self-employed drivers are 60-80% business use. Track ONLY your work shifts, not total odometer miles.</p>

            <h2>Mistake #2: Round Numbers</h2>
            <p><strong>The Red Flag:</strong> You claim exactly 15,000 miles, or 10,000 miles, or 20,000 miles.</p>
            <p><strong>Why It's Bad:</strong> Real mileage logs show precise numbers like 14,873 or 9,234. Round numbers suggest you guessed instead of tracking.</p>
            <p><strong>The Fix:</strong> Use photo-based tracking (MileageSnaps) or GPS apps that capture exact odometer readings. Precision shows you kept real records.</p>

            <h2>Mistake #3: No Supporting Documentation</h2>
            <p><strong>The Red Flag:</strong> You claim $9,450 in mileage deductions (13,500 miles × $0.70) but have no mileage log.</p>
            <p><strong>Why It's Bad:</strong> IRS Publication 463 requires "adequate records." Saying "I drove a lot for Uber" without proof means $0 deduction.</p>
            <p><strong>The Fix:</strong> Keep a mileage log with dates, starting/ending locations, miles, and business purpose. Photo evidence (odometer pics) is even better.</p>

            <h2>Mistake #4: Backdating Your Log</h2>
            <p><strong>The Red Flag:</strong> On April 10 (right before tax deadline), you create a mileage log for all of last year.</p>
            <p><strong>Why It's Bad:</strong> The IRS wants "contemporaneous" records - created at or near the time of each trip. Reconstructed logs are weak evidence.</p>
            <p><strong>The Fix:</strong> Track mileage in real-time. If you forgot, note in your log: "Reconstructed from calendar and bank records." But don't do this again in 2025!</p>

            <h2>Mistake #5: Deducting Commuting Miles</h2>
            <p><strong>The Red Flag:</strong> You drive from home to your office every day and deduct those miles.</p>
            <p><strong>Why It's Bad:</strong> Commuting to a "regular workplace" is NEVER deductible, even if you're self-employed.</p>
            <p><strong>The Fix:</strong> Only deduct miles AFTER you reach your first business location. If you work from home (your principal place of business), trips to clients ARE deductible.</p>

            <h2>Mistake #6: Claiming Personal Trips as Business</h2>
            <p><strong>The Red Flag:</strong> Your GPS log shows a Saturday trip to the mall labeled "business meeting."</p>
            <p><strong>Why It's Bad:</strong> If audited, the IRS will ask for proof of the business purpose. No proof = deduction denied + penalties.</p>
            <p><strong>The Fix:</strong> Only log trips with a clear business purpose. Add notes like "Met with client Smith at Starbucks - contract negotiation."</p>

            <h2>Mistake #7: Not Tracking Trips Under 10 Miles</h2>
            <p><strong>The Red Flag:</strong> You skip logging short trips because "it's not worth it."</p>
            <p><strong>Why It's Bad:</strong> Those 5-mile trips add up: 200 short trips × 5 miles × $0.70 = $700 in lost deductions.</p>
            <p><strong>The Fix:</strong> Track EVERY business trip. With MileageSnaps, it takes 5 seconds to snap start/end photos - no excuse to skip short trips.</p>

            <h2>Mistake #8: Mixing Methods (Standard + Actual)</h2>
            <p><strong>The Red Flag:</strong> You claim standard mileage ($0.70/mile) AND deduct gas receipts.</p>
            <p><strong>Why It's Bad:</strong> You can't do both! The standard rate already includes gas, maintenance, depreciation, etc.</p>
            <p><strong>The Fix:</strong> Pick ONE method: standard mileage OR actual expenses. (Standard is usually better for high-mileage drivers.)</p>

            <h2>Mistake #9: No Start/End Odometer Readings</h2>
            <p><strong>The Red Flag:</strong> Your log says "drove to 3 client meetings, 45 miles total" but doesn't show odometer readings.</p>
            <p><strong>Why It's Bad:</strong> The IRS prefers logs with starting/ending odometer to verify accuracy. Without them, your "45 miles" looks like a guess.</p>
            <p><strong>The Fix:</strong> Photo-based tracking solves this. Every shift has a start photo (odometer 45,230) and end photo (45,275).</p>

            <h2>Mistake #10: Deducting Miles You Didn't Drive</h2>
            <p><strong>The Red Flag:</strong> You claim 50 miles for a "client meeting" but your GPS shows you only drove 30 miles.</p>
            <p><strong>Why It's Bad:</strong> Inflating mileage is fraud. If caught, you'll owe back taxes + 20-75% penalties + possible criminal charges.</p>
            <p><strong>The Fix:</strong> Be honest. Track only the miles you actually drove. Photo evidence protects you from accidentally over-claiming.</p>

            <div class="warning-box">
                <strong>Real Audit Story:</strong> A rideshare driver claimed 22,000 business miles but couldn't provide a mileage log. The IRS disallowed the entire $14,740 deduction and assessed a 20% negligence penalty ($2,948). Total cost: $17,688. Don't let this happen to you.
            </div>

            <h2>How to Avoid These Mistakes</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Use photo-based tracking:</strong> MileageSnaps creates audit-proof logs automatically</li>
                <li><strong>Track in real-time:</strong> Log each shift when it happens, not months later</li>
                <li><strong>Be conservative:</strong> When in doubt, DON'T claim a trip as business</li>
                <li><strong>Add notes:</strong> Write why each trip was necessary ("Met client to discuss Q1 contract")</li>
                <li><strong>Keep backups:</strong> Export your mileage log monthly (CSV or PDF)</li>
            </ol>

            <p><strong>Bottom line:</strong> The IRS is looking for honest mistakes, not perfection. But sloppy record-keeping costs you thousands in denied deductions. Start 2025 with clean, accurate mileage tracking.</p>
