            <h2>What the IRS Requires for Mileage Deductions</h2>
            <p>According to IRS Publication 463 (Travel, Entertainment, Gift, and Car Expenses), you must keep records that show:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Date:</strong> When the trip occurred</li>
                <li><strong>Mileage:</strong> Total miles driven for business</li>
                <li><strong>Business Purpose:</strong> Why you made the trip (e.g., "Client meeting," "Uber shift," "Delivery run")</li>
                <li><strong>Destination:</strong> Where you went (city/area is sufficient)</li>
                <li><strong>Starting & Ending Odometer:</strong> Not explicitly required, but strongly recommended for audit defense</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <strong>Important:</strong> The IRS doesn't mandate HOW you track mileage - only that your records are "adequate" and "contemporaneous" (created at or near the time of the trip).
            </div>

            <h2>Why Photo Proof Beats GPS Logs</h2>
            <p>While GPS mileage trackers are popular, photo evidence of your odometer provides stronger audit protection:</p>

            <h3>1. Tamper-Proof Evidence</h3>
            <p>Odometer photos are physical, timestamped evidence. GPS logs are digital and can appear manipulated (even if they're not). IRS auditors trust photos more because they're harder to fake.</p>

            <h3>2. Shows Conscious Business Intent</h3>
            <p>Taking a photo at the start and end of your work shift demonstrates you INTENTIONALLY tracked business miles - not just captured all driving and sorted later. The IRS values this deliberate record-keeping.</p>

            <h3>3. No "Personal Trip" Sorting Required</h3>
            <p>GPS trackers record ALL trips (grocery store, gym, visiting friends). You must then classify each as "business" or "personal." Mistakes here trigger audits. With photo tracking, you ONLY log business shifts - no sorting needed.</p>

            <h3>4. Matches IRS Guidance Perfectly</h3>
            <p>The IRS publishes sample mileage logs in Publication 463. They show: date, odometer start/end, total miles, business purpose. MileageSnaps creates exactly this format with photo proof attached.</p>

            <h3>5. Works When GPS Fails</h3>
            <p>GPS can be inaccurate in cities (tall buildings), tunnels, parking garages, or rural areas. Your odometer is always accurate - it's a mechanical/digital meter certified by the vehicle manufacturer.</p>

            <div class="warning-box">
                <strong>Audit Red Flag:</strong> Many drivers using GPS trackers forget to classify trips, leading to 100% business use claims. The IRS WILL question why you never drove your car personally. Photo-based tracking avoids this issue entirely.
            </div>

            <h2>Real Audit Scenarios</h2>

            <h3>Scenario 1: GPS Log Questioned</h3>
            <p><em>"Your GPS log shows you drove 18,000 business miles last year. That's 90% of your total mileage. Do you never drive to the grocery store or visit family?"</em></p>
            <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Over-claiming business use triggers suspicion.</p>
            <p><strong>MileageSnaps Advantage:</strong> You only log actual work shifts. Your total is realistic (e.g., 15,000 miles across 230 shifts).</p>

            <h3>Scenario 2: "Prove This Trip Happened"</h3>
            <p><em>"On March 15th, you claim 87 miles for 'client meetings.' Show me proof."</em></p>
            <p><strong>With GPS:</strong> You show a map with a route. Auditor asks, "How do I know you didn't drive to a friend's house and call it business?"</p>
            <p><strong>With MileageSnaps:</strong> You show photos of your odometer at 45,230 mi (9:15am) and 45,317 mi (4:42pm), tagged "Client Meetings - Downtown." Plus notes: "Met with Johnson Corp, visited 3 properties." <strong>Case closed.</strong></p>

            <h3>Scenario 3: Schedule C Business Use Percentage</h3>
            <p>If you claim the Standard Mileage Deduction on Schedule C (Form 1040), the IRS may ask for your business use percentage. Photo logs make this simple: 15,000 business miles ÷ 20,000 total miles = 75% business use. This percentage applies to other vehicle expenses (insurance, registration, etc.).</p>

            <h2>What Happens in an Audit Without Good Records?</h2>
            <p>If you're audited and lack adequate mileage records, the IRS will:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Disallow your deduction</strong> entirely (you lose $10,500+ in tax savings)</li>
                <li><strong>Assess back taxes</strong> + interest + potential penalties (20-40% extra)</li>
                <li><strong>Question other deductions</strong> on your return (opening a deeper audit)</li>
            </ol>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <strong>Real Case Example:</strong> In <em>Hathaway v. Commissioner</em> (2014), a taxpayer lost $18,000 in mileage deductions because their GPS log lacked business purpose notes. The court ruled the records were "not adequate." Photo logs with purpose tags would have saved this case.

            <h2>Common Questions</h2>

            <h3>Do I need to keep physical photos?</h3>
            <p>No. Digital photos stored on your iPhone (and backed up to iCloud with MileageSnaps Pro) are fully acceptable. The IRS accepts electronic records as long as they're retrievable and legible.</p>

            <h3>Can I still use MileageSnaps if I sometimes forget to log shifts?</h3>
            <p>Yes! You can manually enter past shifts if you remember your odometer readings. While not as strong as real-time photos, notes like "forgot to log, reconstructed from memory" show good-faith effort.</p>

            <h3>What if my odometer breaks or I get a new car mid-year?</h3>
            <p>Note the change in your records. Example: "Switched to new vehicle on 6/15/25. Old car final odometer: 87,450. New car starting: 12." The IRS understands vehicle changes - just document them.</p>

            <h3>Is photo tracking "IRS-approved"?</h3>
            <p>The IRS doesn't "approve" specific apps. They require adequate records. MileageSnaps meets and exceeds IRS Publication 463 guidance, giving you audit-proof documentation.</p>
